To recap, the idea for this project is to show lateral and vertical flight path data from MSFS 2020 rendered on top of FAA aeronautical charts. To be clear, I have no idea what I’m doing but I’m hoping we’ll figure it out toge... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PMP Update 7: Web project setup with Next.js and Docker</title><link href="https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp7-web-project-setup-with-nextjs-and-docker/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PMP Update 7: Web project setup with Next.js and Docker" /><published>2024-01-18T11:53:00+13:00</published> <updated>2024-01-18T18:12:38+13:00</updated> <id>https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp7-web-project-setup-with-nextjs-and-docker/</id> <content src="https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp7-web-project-setup-with-nextjs-and-docker/" /> <author> <name>Pete Russell</name> </author> <category term="projects" /> <category term="pmp" /> <summary> Preamble Now we have the web API running in Docker, the next job is to set up a project for the frontend and get that running in a container as well. I decided on React given it’s the frontend language I’m most familiar with, paired with Next.js which seems to be framework-of-the-month (unless it’s out of date by the time I publish this). I have some experience with Next.js from a little whil... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PMP Update 6: Creating and running the Web API container</title><link href="https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp6-running-webapi-in-docker/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PMP Update 6: Creating and running the Web API container" /><published>2024-01-08T10:58:00+13:00</published> <updated>2024-01-18T17:53:56+13:00</updated> <id>https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp6-running-webapi-in-docker/</id> <content src="https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp6-running-webapi-in-docker/" /> <author> <name>Pete Russell</name> </author> <category term="projects" /> <category term="pmp" /> <summary> Setup Docker Desktop Windows 10 Home Visual Studio Web API Project setup and layout I wanted to try implementing the API following the Clean Architecture approach, and using a repository pattern outlined here (as an aside, I’ve found Milan Jovanović’s videos &amp;amp; newsletters full of great content, no affiliation). So far the API, Domain, and Persistence projects have been implement... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting up Minikube on Windows</title><link href="https://httpete.nz/posts/setting-up-minikube-on-windows/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting up Minikube on Windows" /><published>2023-12-24T03:36:00+13:00</published> <updated>2023-12-24T03:36:00+13:00</updated> <id>https://httpete.nz/posts/setting-up-minikube-on-windows/</id> <content src="https://httpete.nz/posts/setting-up-minikube-on-windows/" /> <author> <name>Pete Russell</name> </author> <category term="kubernetes" /> <summary> Minikube Minikube is an application for running a local Kubernetes cluster, which makes it perfect for developing locally and learning about Kubernetes without having to spin up (and pay for) a K8s cluster in the cloud. Minikube runs inside a virtual machine, so you’ll need a container or VM manager installed for it to run in. I went with Docker Desktop on Windows but QEMU, Hyperkit, Hyper-V,... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PMP Update 5: Architecture, use case, life update</title><link href="https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp5-architecture-use-case-life-update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PMP Update 5: Architecture, use case, life update" /><published>2023-12-21T21:17:00+13:00</published> <updated>2023-12-24T13:25:27+13:00</updated> <id>https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp5-architecture-use-case-life-update/</id> <content src="https://httpete.nz/posts/pmp5-architecture-use-case-life-update/" /> <author> <name>Pete Russell</name> </author> <category term="projects" /> <category term="pmp" /> <summary> Life update After a short 1 year, 3 months, and 29 day process, my green card has been issued. It’s been a whirlwind since. We packed up life in Christchurch, moved to the Chicago North Shore and bought a house near the Chicago Botanic Garden, haggled for a car, started preschool, re-learned how to speak American, and generally pretended to be grown-ups.
