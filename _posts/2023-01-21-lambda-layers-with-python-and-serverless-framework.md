# Lambda layers with python and serverless framework

## Preamble

[GroundSchool NZ](https://groundschool.co.nz) is currently deployed to AWS using Terraform, but I've recently been moving some pieces to [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com) (SLS) with the ultimate goal of having a split between Terraform and SLS. It's still a work in progress, but the idea would be:
 - Terraform - infra layer:
   - IAM, Route53, CloudFront (maybe?), S3 deployment-related buckets
 - Serverless framework - app layer:
   - Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API gateway

The existing Lambda functions were put together pretty roughly, and have a lot of duplicated utility code for things like HTTP requests/responses and interacting with DynamoDB. It seemed like a good opportunity for a tidy-up.

I looked at options for sharing python functions with Serverless. SLS has a plugin framework and I found a few plugins that seemed to handle this in various ways, but then realized that [Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) did what I wanted 'natively'.

## Folder structure

I have a `web-api` Serverless Framework service defined. Inside that we've got a `common` folder for shared functions, and a `functions` folder for the API endpoints that respond to API gateway events -- this should be able to access the layer we create with functions in `common`, eg. `db_utils`, `list_utils`, etc.

> **Important: `/common/python`:** in order for Lambda to be able to find functions in the layer, shared code must be in a folder called `python`. The root folder (eg. `common`) can be wherever you want, but the immediate child needs to be a directory called `python`, which in turn contains your shared functions.

```
web-api
|- serverless.yml
|- common
   |- python
      |- db_utils.py
      |- request_utils.py
      |- response_utils.py

|- functions
   |- exams
      |- exams.py
      |- serverless.yml
   |- questions
      |- questions.py
      |- serverless.yml
```

## Defining the layer in `serverless.yml`

### 1. Add a layers section to your root `serverless.yml` file
```
provider:
  ...

layers:
  common:
    path: common
    compatibleRuntimes:
      - python3.9
    description: 'Shared utilities'

functions:
  ...
```
 - `common:` - the name used to reference your layer - choose whatever makes sense
 - `path` - points to the root directory for your layer, which contains the `/python` directory with shared functions

More detail on the SLS layers configuration: [https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/layers](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/layers)


### 2. Add the layer to your provider in `serverless.yml`
```
provider:
  name: aws
  ...
  layers:
   - !Ref CommonLambdaLayer
```

 - Replace `CommonLambdaLayer` with the layer name you chose in step 1, and a suffix 'LambdaLayer'. eg. if you named your layer `utils` instead of `common`, you'd change this to `- !Ref UtilsLambdaLayer`

## Writing the layer code

Nothing special here -- just add python functions and save as a `.py` file.

`response_utils.py`:
```python
import json

def make_200(response_body):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(response_body)
    }
```

## Using functions in the layer

Import the module that we created in Step 3 and use the function!
```python
import response_utils

def get(event, context):
    try:
        return response_utils.make_200({ 'availableExams': { 'name': 'PPL Air Law' } })
```
