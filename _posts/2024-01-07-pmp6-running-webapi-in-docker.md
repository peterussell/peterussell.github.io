## Web API Project setup and layout

I wanted to try implementing the API following the [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture)
approach, and using a repository pattern outlined [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwehxBDX_o8&t=111s)
(as an aside, I've found Milan JovanoviÄ‡'s videos & newsletters full of great content, no affiliation).

So far the `API`, `Domain`, and `Persistence` projects have been implemented for the purpose
of getting the container running, and returning a list of basic 'Flight' objects at the endpoint
`/v1/flights`. The `Domain` and `Persistence` projects are Class Library (DLL) projects, and `API` 
is a Web API project. `API` is what actually gets invoked in the container, and references the other two.

As an example, here's a simple (hard-coded) "flight" created to test the API, at `GET /v1/flights`:

### Creating the API project

 1. In Visual Studio > New Project > ASP.NET Core Web API. Click Next.
 2. Fill out a name and location. Click Next.
 3. Choose a framework (I went with .NET 8.0 just to try out the latest & greatest); *disable* Configure for HTTPS
    (we'll worry about HTTPS termination outside of the container); *enable* Enable Docker. Click Create.

I followed similar steps to create the `Domain` and `Persistence` projects, but choosing 
Class Library as the output type (this will be relevant when looking at the `Dockerfile` steps).

## Dockerfile

This is where I landed with the Dockerfile (steps explained below, full file at the end):

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /app
```

Pull down the dotnet SDK image, and set the `WORKDIR` to `/app`. The workdir is the location *in the image* that
subsequent commands are run from.

```
COPY ["api/API.csproj", "api/"]
COPY ["Domain/Domain.csproj", "Domain/"]
COPY ["Persistence/Persistence.csproj", "Peristence/"]
RUN dotnet restore "api/API.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "Domain/Domain.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "Peristence/Persistence.csproj"
```

Copy the three `.csproj` files and run the `dotnet restore` command for each. The reason for copy just the
`.csproj` files (rather than the all the files, which we'll do later) is related to [layers](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/layers/)
in Docker. Each step is cached, so that means if one of the restore steps fails, we haven't wasted a bunch
of time copying all of the files over. However, if these restore steps pass then this gets cached. Essentially
this means if a step later on fails, Docker's smart enough to say "hey - all those copy `.csproj` and `dotnet restore`
steps passed, we don't need to do that again".

```
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish "api/API.csproj" -c Release -o out
```

Copy the rest of the files over and publish the build to a directory called `out`.

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/out ./
```

Cool, now we're done with the build, we want to set up the container image that we actually want to use
for running the app, in this case `dotnet/aspnet:8.0`. This is a stripped down container that doesn't
contain the build tools we used above -- just an environment for running the app (and not much more,
not evening `ping`, `curl`, etc). Then switch into the `/app` workdir (same as above), and copy the
output from the build we just did.

```
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "API.dll"]
```

Finally, `ASPNETCORE_URLS` [tells dotnet to run on port 8080](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/web-host?view=aspnetcore-8.0),
which `EXPOSE` makes available from the container to the outside world. The last thing is to tell docker what to run when the container starts up, which is
given by the `ENTRYPOINT` command.

### Full `Dockerfile`

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /app

COPY ["api/API.csproj", "api/"]
COPY ["Domain/Domain.csproj", "Domain/"]
COPY ["Persistence/Persistence.csproj", "Peristence/"]
RUN dotnet restore "api/API.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "Domain/Domain.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "Peristence/Persistence.csproj"

COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish "api/API.csproj" -c Release -o out

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/out ./

ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "API.dll"]

```

## Building the image

Now we need to build the image, and then run the container so we can access the app.

One of the important parts here that I got a little stumped on, is that we need to run `docker build` from
within the `API` project, because that's where the Dockerfile is. However, because we have references to
projects up one level, we need to set the directory for the command to be up a level, ie. `../`.

The project structure looks like this:

```
src
|- API
   |- Dockerfile
|- Domain
|- Persistence
```

So, to build the image (assuming [Docker's installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)),
we can run:

```
docker build -t api -f Dockerfile ../
```

 - `-t api` - tags the image as "api"
 - `-f Dockerfile` - tells `docker build` to use the Dockerfile specified at this path (in this case the current API directory)
 - `../` - run the command from a directory up

If the build succeeds, you can run `docker images` in the terminal, and you should see the newly created image.

## Running the container

In a terminal, run this to start the container (assuming the container's named `api` as above)

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 api
```

 - `-p 8080:8080` - forwards port 8080 on the *host*, to port 8080 in the *container* (which we configured above in our
   Dockerfile). This lets you browse to `http://localhost:8080` and hit the API running in the container. As an example,
   if you wanted to browse to `http://localhost:9999` on your machine (ie. the host), but still running the application
   on port 8080 inside the container, you could instead specify `-p 9999:8080`.

**IMPORTANT** (AKA a wee mistake that took me too long to figure out) the port mapping needs to come *before* the name
of the image. Otherwise, although no errors are shown, you won't be able to connect to the container.

If all this works, you should now be able to browse to `http://localhost:8080/{your-api-path}` and see your containerized
API :)

## Swagger

A cool feature baked in to Web API is support for OpenAPI documentation with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), which
gives automatic documentation of the API.

By default this only enabled for development builds, which means it isn't available on the container we just built above,
however if you a) run the app in the container in dev mode b) change the swagger settings in `Program.cs`, or c)
run the application directly from Visual Studio (see "Running with IISExpress" below), then Swagger documentation
will be available at `<your-app-url>/swagger/v1/swagger.json`:

## Troubleshooting

### Running from Visual Studio

If you chose "Enable Docker" when creating the project, by default Visual Studio will run the application in a
Docker container in VS when you hit Run/F5. This is pretty cool, but you might want to troubleshoot without the
intermediate layer of the container.

To do this, look for the "Docker" run configuration dropdown in the top toolbar, next to the "Solution Configurations"
and "Solution Platforms" dropdowns (usually say "Debug" "Any CPU" by default).

Click the dropdown displaying Docker, and change the setting to IISExpress. Run the project, which should now
be running on the default IISExpress ports (see API > Properties > `launchSettings.json`).

### Viewing container information

Docker Desktop has come a long way since the last time I used it. It gives a great overview of container info
including logs, stats, output from `docker inspect` organized by category (eg. network config), bind mounts, and
a terminal (Exec) into the container.

I found this particularly useful trying to troubleshoot port mapping, when I noticed the port wasn't shown as
mapped in the Docker Desktop UI.

If you prefer to use the CLI, these commands may be useful:

 - `docker images` - view all docker images (and hashes)
 - `docker ps` - view all running containers
 - `docker inspect <hash>` - view configuration information for a container
 - `docker image rm <hash>` - remove a container image (might need `--force`)

### Can't reach the application via on localhost

Things to check:

 - Are you running the Web API application on the correct port? (`ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable, see above)
 - Has the port been exposed by the container to the outside world? (`EXPOSE` in Dockerfile, see above)
 - Did you specify `-p <host-port>:<container-port>` when you called `docker run`? (eg. `docker run -p 8080:8080 api`)
   - Did the port come *before* the container image name?

## Next steps

I hope that's helpful for someone who's trying to achieve the same, and avoid running into a few of the issues
that stumped me.

Now that's running, the next mini-project is to get the React/Next web application running in a separate container,
and get the two talking to each other.
