### Background

My situation is, I think, similar to many mid-career oftware developers:
despite working as a professional programmer for the last few years, I feel
pretty out of touch with some of the more computer science-y topics covered
a "while back" at university.

To be completely honest, I'd probably struggle to talk confidently about
some common interview topics like, hash maps, sorting algorithms,
time or space complexity, etc., and I've also been keen for a while now
to dig deeper into clean code architecture and patterns.

I actually remember it being pretty fun learning how to implement these things,
and find out how they work under the hood.

### So, a plan...

I figured a good approach to tackle this would be to find a list of
topics and work through them one-by-one.
[This list looks good](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/).
Although aimed at people preparing for tech interviews, it's a nice
outline of fundamental CS topics without being overwhelming.

### Play along at home

If you want to join in I've set up a
[CS Refresher GitHub repository](https://github.com/peterussell/cs-refresher.git).
As I work through the topics I'll summarise notes on whatever I've been
learning about, write some example code, and copy the notes over to this
site as well.
