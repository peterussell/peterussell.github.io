### Background

My situation is similar - I think - to many mid-career oftware developers:
despite working as a professional programmer for the last few years, I feel
pretty out of touch with some of the more 'computer science-y' topics covered
at university.

To be completely honest, I'd probably struggle to talk confidently about
interview staples like linked lists, hash maps, time or space complexity,
etc., and I've also been keen for a while now to dig deeper into clean code
architecture and patterns.

### So, a plan...

I figured a good approach to tackle this would be to find a list of
topics and work through them one-by-one.
[This list looks good](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/).
Although aimed at people preparing for tech interviews, it's a nice
outline of fundamental CS topics without being overwhelming.

### Play along at home

If you want to join in I've set up a
[CS Refresher GitHub repository](https://github.com/peterussell/cs-refresher.git).
As I work through the topics I'll summarise notes on whatever I've been
learning about, write some example code, and add a copy of the notes on this
site.
